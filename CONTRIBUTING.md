# Contributing Guideline 

1. Use naming format ```<judge> <problem id> - <problem name> <version>```. For example -

    **_UVa 202 - Repeating Decimals v2.cpp_**
    
    Here include ```<version>``` only for >1, i. e. mentioning v1 is not necessary.
    
2. Put code for exercise problems in the ```Exercises``` folder of the chapter.

3. For alternate solutions, put the solving technique in a comment at the top of the file. Like this:
    ```cpp
    /**
     *    Problem: Timus 1005 - Stone Pile
     *    Approach: bitmask with memorization
    **/
    ```
    In file name, put v1, v2 etc.
4. See the existing files for more formatting guideline.
